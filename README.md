# ML_Malware_Detection
## Project Setup

To set up this machine learning environment, you will need Python 3. The following dependencies will also need to be installed: jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, and seaborn. It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment (like venv) or to use pipenv (instructions are google-able).

Once your dependencies are installed, you can start up a jupyter notebook session in the terminal using the command: jupyter notebook. Notebooks are somewhat easy to understand; however, you may want to read some tutorials online. To run an entire notebook (not just one cell), go to the Run tab and choose Run all cells.
